act-responsive
==============

Basic template and assets pack for ACT to look responsive and from this century.

This repo provides an almost Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) pure theme for ACT (https://github.com/book/Act). This means you can apply Bootstrap themes into it to customize colors, fonts, etc. I really encourage you to do it.

This is not intended to be a final ACT theme. It's ratter an attempt to provide a nicer default to customize. This is basically an upgrade of the default ACT templates that also looks good on mobile.

Act-responsive is under development. Some templates are not ported yet and some others still need work. All feedback and help will be trully welcome. Feel free to open an issue or do a pull request.
